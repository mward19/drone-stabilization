# Finding Balance: A Dive Into Drone Dynamics and Optimal Control

This repository contains code and derivations we did for our ACME Volume 4B modeling project. We are attempting to model the optimal control for a quadrocopter.

Given the research nature of our work, this code is not yet carefully organized. Feel free to explore our work.
